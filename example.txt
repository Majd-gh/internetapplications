Late at night, the city is quiet, with the moonlight dancing on the trees.
Cats roam the empty streets, their small voices echoing under the peaceful night sky.
The call to prayer rises, summoning the faithful to the dawn prayer, and people gradually awaken from their slumber.
Life begins to creep back into the city, with shops opening and cafes unlocking their doors.
The sound of passersby fills the streets, and people exchange greetings and smiles on their way.
The smell of freshly roasted coffee wafts through the air, drawing many to enjoy a cup.
Friends gather in cafes, starting their day with conversation and laughter.
Some head off to work or school, each striving to achieve their goals and fulfill their responsibilities.
The city continues to breathe and move throughout the day, until night returns and peace settles over the city once again.
